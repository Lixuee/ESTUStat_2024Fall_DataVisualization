# Final Projects

## Topic

Prepare a poster that explains a given problem or message through data storytelling.

## Evaluation

The posters will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Content and presentation (20 points),
2. Use of various charts (30 points),
3. Selection of appropriate charts and necessary adjustments (30 points).

Additionally, creating a GitHub repository that includes all the content used in preparing the charts will be worth 20 points. The repository must include:

* A `Readme.md` page (containing chart outputs, code used to prepare the charts, and information on the data source),
* Chart files (in .png or .pdf format),
* Code files (in .R file format),
* Data files (in .csv format).

## Presentation

Project presentations are scheduled to take place on Friday, January 5, 2024, between 14:00 and 16:00, in an open event at the Faculty of Science Foyer. During this time, all posters must be displayed on the boards in the area. It is expected that all preparations be completed at least 15 minutes before the event.

## Poster Preparation Guidelines

* The poster must be prepared in **A1** size, in a vertical format.
* The poster must include the name of the author, institution, and contact information (email only).
* The data source must be cited within the text.
* Ensure the resolution of the charts is appropriate, as low-resolution charts can make the poster difficult to read. You can adjust the size of titles, text, and aesthetics within the charts to match the size of the text on the poster.
* You can use any tool to prepare the poster, such as R Markdown, Quarto, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), PowerPoint, etc.
* You can check the bestposter method [here](https://github.com/GerkeLab/betterposter) and use their templates.

## Suggested Data Sources

* You can check out the data sources listed in the GitHub repository for the [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/MAT381E-Fall21#data-related-links) course offered by the ITU Department of Mathematical Engineering.
* Some international official data sources for R are available [here](https://github.com/mcavs/R-open-dataset-packages).

### Example Projects for Inspiration:
